# Energy-Efficiency-Prediction-Model-for-Building

## Developed a building energy consumption predictive model, analyzing 768 samples with 8 features to forecast heating and cooling loads
## Applied six main ML approaches (RF, DT, KNN, GB, ANN, SVM) with over 99.5% prediction accuracy for both loads, using GridSearchCV for automated hyperparameter tuning.
